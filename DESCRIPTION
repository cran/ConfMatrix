Description: Thematic quality indices are provided to facilitate the evaluation
    and quality control of geospatial data products (e.g. thematic maps, remote
    sensing classifications, etc.). The indices offered are based on the
    so-called confusion matrix. This matrix is constructed by comparing the
    assigned classes or attributes of a set of pairs of positions or objects
    in the product and the ground truth. In this package it is considered that
    the classes of the ground truth correspond to the columns and that the
    classes of the product to be valued correspond to the rows. The package
    offers two object classes with their methods: 'ConfMatrix' (Confusion
    matrix) and 'QCCS' (Quality Control Columns Set). The 'ConfMatrix' class of
    objects offers more than 20 methods based on the confusion matrix. The
    'QCCS' class of objects offers a different perspective in which the ground
    truth is considered to allow the values of the column marginals to be fixed,

    (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.rse.2006.10.010> for more details. The package was
    created with 'R6'.
