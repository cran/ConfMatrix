\title{Quality Control Columns Set}
\description{
The difference between a QCCS and a confusion matrix is
that while forming a confusion matrix requires that the reference and
the product be more or less equivalent, for the QCCS it is required
that the reference be actually of higher quality than the product.
This forces us to leave the marginals corresponding to the reference
fixed. That is why we work by columns. In this way, the QCCS class
works with a confusion matrix expressed as a set of column vectors
and it will be analyzed by columns. A QCCS is constructed by comparing
a sample of a set of common positions in the product and the ground
truth. Appropriate sampling methods must be applied to generate the
QCCS. It is considered that the classes of the ground truth
correspond to the columns and that the classes of the
product to be valued correspond to the rows. On the other hand, the
concept of QCCS is directly linked to quality control, so the
specifications of this control must be indicated \insertCite{QCCS}{ConfMatrix}.
Specifications are stated as percentages. E.g. for class "A" under
consideration, a minimum quality value is established (e.g. better than 90\%), and
maximum values of confusion with other categories (e.g. confusion
between A and B less than 5\%). The specifications are proportions of
a multinomial. First, an object of this class of object must be
created (instantiated) and then the methods that offer the index
calculations will be invoked.
